# RelaiMqttServer 

This application is intended for the automated control of Shelly relays.

The status of the registered Shelly relays is to be read out using Mqttbroker. The most important parameters are to be displayed via a GUI based on a web app.

In the web app, it should be possible to set a maximum watt value for all relays, as well as a power reserve and prioritise lines. 

If the maximum watt value or the reserve to be maintained is reached, all unused lines should be switched off or switched on again if the value or the reserve is not reached.

This is intended to prevent overloading of the fuse contacts and prevent the RCD from tripping. 

Prioritising the lines should ensure that there is always enough power available for certain devices
